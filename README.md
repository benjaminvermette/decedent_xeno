# Bulk gDNA TCRB CDR3 Analysis – Xeno-Transplant Study

This repository contains the code used to analyze **bulk gDNA TCRB CDR3 sequencing data** (generated by Adaptive Biotechnologies) for the *Nature* manuscript:

> **Comprehensive Analysis of Long-Term Pig-to-Human Decedent Kidney Xeno-Transplant**

---

## Overview
The scripts and workflows provided here reproduce the analyses of TCRβ repertoires described in the paper. They include data preprocessing, repertoire characterization, statistical testing, and figure generation.

## Repository Structure
- `scripts/` – analysis/figure scripts  
  Each script is associated with one or more figures in the manuscript.  
  **Note:** while scripts are linked to specific figures, most analyses rely on outputs from other scripts, so they often need to be run together as specified in the workflow.  

  - `Identifying_XDRTCCs.R` (Figure 3D; Extended Figure 5A)
  - `Identifying_NonXDRTCCs.R` (Figures 3E & 3F)
  - `RelativeAbundancePlots.R` (Figure 3A)
  - `AlluvialPlots.R` (Figures 3B & 3C)
  - `Nucleotide_to_AA_ConvergenceAnalysis.R` (Extended Figure 5B)
- `helper/` – functions for cleaning/formatting
- `stats/` – statistical testing scripts
- `README.md`


## Requirements
- R (≥ 4.3.0)
- Raw data can be downloaded from Adaptive Biotechnologies' **immuneACCESS** database. Detailed instructions for retrieving and formatting the data are included in the scripts.
