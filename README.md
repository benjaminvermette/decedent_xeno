## Overview
The scripts and workflows provided here reproduce the analyses of TCRβ repertoires described in the paper. They include data preprocessing, repertoire characterization, statistical testing, and figure generation.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – placeholder for raw or processed `.tsv` files (not included here if restricted).
- `scripts/` – R scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `results/` – output tables and figures generated by the code.
- `README.md` – this file.

## Requirements
- R (≥ 4.0)
- Commonly used packages: `tidyverse`, `data.table`, `ggplot2`, `reshape2`, etc.
- Additional dependencies may be listed in individual scripts.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/benjaminvermette/decedent_xeno].git
