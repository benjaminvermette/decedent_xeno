## Overview
The scripts and workflows provided here reproduce the analyses of TCRβ repertoires described in the paper. They include data preprocessing, repertoire characterization, statistical testing, and figure generation.

## Repository Structure
- `scripts/` – R scripts used for data analysis and visualization.
- `helper/` - R functions necessary for data cleaning and formatting.
- `stats/` - R scripts used for statistical analysis.
- `README.md` – this file.

## Requirements
- R (≥ 4.0)
- Commonly used packages: `tidyverse`, `data.table`, `ggplot2`, `reshape2`, etc.
- Raw data can be downloaded from Adaptive Biotechnologies' **immuneACCESS** database. Detailed instructions for retrieving and formatting the data are included in the scripts.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
